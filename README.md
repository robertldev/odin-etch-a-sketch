Odin Foundations Project - Etch-a-Sketch

This is one of the final Foundations courses on The Odin Project - an Etch-a-Sketch.

It's essentially further training on working with the DOM, to allow the user to create a specified number of boxes as part of their Etch-a-Sketch, and to see how we can manipulate those subsequent boxes with the cursor.
